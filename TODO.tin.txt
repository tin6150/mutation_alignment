for testing in 2010.1017 run ./clustalw-align5.pl.cgi 

or 
http://165.140.60.9/~hoti1/cgi-bin/clustalw-align5.pl.cgi

as of 2010.1220 not sure if web page works.
current test method is from CLI:
date ; ./clustalw-align5.pl.cgi > clustalw-align5.html ; date
it produce html output to a file in 
file://///phusem-s6000/unixhome/hoti1.emc/tmp/mut/mut_clustalw_out.html
~hoti1/tmp/mut/mut_clustalw_out.html

--

orthologList.pm  ... 
probably done for orthologList...

executeClustalw() largely done

NEXT:
v- review clustaw to get primary seq out first
   this affect alignment highlght/tag as seq may have front offset!
 - review that mutation.pm can provide as way out output...  
~- algorithm for printAlignment()
~- add the necessary fn to mutation.pm	[probably okay now]


v- retrieveGeneSeq()  use geneid
  worry about not being able to find it our db check code?
  at least make sure human is findable and use oracle!
  x- may need additional db query to get accession number, maybe update ncbi_get


v- printAlignment... to do block of 50 AA only at a time...

- counter line
- frequency coloring
- fasta name/desc line ... to show up nicer in legend
